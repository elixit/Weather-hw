## The goal of this website is to display a 5 day future forecast, starting with the current date displayed at the top of the page. The forecast should display temperature, wind, and humidity. One of the features required is a search bar which allows the user to find their city's forecast. The cities that the user searches are stored in the local storage. The saved cities are displayed to the page. When the user clicks it, it shows that specific forecast. There is a "clear history" option.
